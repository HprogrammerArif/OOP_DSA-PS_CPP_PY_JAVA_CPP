# Problem Solving Repository

This repository contains various implementations of algorithms and data structures in multiple programming languages including Python and Java. The focus is on solving common problems using object-oriented programming principles.

## Directory Structure

- **PYTHON/**: Contains Python implementations.
  - **PRACTICE/**: Includes practice files for recursion and factorial calculations.
    - `factorial.py`: Implements both iterative and recursive methods to calculate factorial.
    - `palindrome.py`: (Add description when implemented)
    - `recursion.py`: Demonstrates recursion with sum of natural numbers and printing a list.

- **search/**: Contains Java implementations for searching algorithms.
  - `SearchInTwoDArray.java`: (Add description when implemented)
  - `twoDArray.java`: (Add description when implemented)

- **SoOn/**: Contains additional Java implementations.
  - `EvenDigits.java`: (Add description when implemented)

- **SORT/**: Contains sorting algorithm implementations.
  - `bubbleSort.java`: (Add description when implemented)

## Usage

To run the Python scripts, ensure you have Python installed and execute the scripts using:

```sh
python <script_name>.py
```

For Java files, compile and run using:

```sh
javac <file_name>.java
java <file_name>
```
